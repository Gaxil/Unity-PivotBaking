System requirements
-------------------

Creating you own compatible shader
----------------------------------
The provided shader has been made with Amplify shader editor and you can easily modify it to match your needs.
You need to install Amplify shader editor in the project in order to edit the shaders properly.
If you want to create an HLSL shader or HDRP/URP shader, it should be pretty straightforward to do it.
